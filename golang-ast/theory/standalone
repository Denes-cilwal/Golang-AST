The compiled code of a Go program can run on another machine if the target machine has the same operating system and architecture for which the code was compiled.
 Go's ability to create standalone executables makes this process straightforward under these conditions.
 However, if you need to run the Go program on a different platform (different OS or architecture), you have to use cross-compilation. Here's how it works:

Running on the Same Platform
If you compile a Go program on a 64-bit Windows machine,
the resulting executable will run on any other 64-bit Windows machine without needing the Go runtime or any other dependencies installed.

This is because the Go compiler statically links all dependencies, including the Go runtime, into the executable.

Cross-Compilation for Different Platforms
Go supports cross-compilation, which allows you to compile your program for a different platform than the one you are currently using.
For instance, you can compile a Go program on a macOS machine for a Linux-based system, or compile on an x86 architecture machine for an ARM architecture.

How to Cross-Compile in Go:
Set Target OS and Architecture: Before compiling, set the GOOS and GOARCH environment variables to match the target platform.
GOOS refers to the operating system (like linux, windows, darwin for macOS), and GOARCH refers to the architecture (like amd64, arm64, etc.).

Compile the Program: Run the go build command to compile the program for the specified platform.

Example of Cross-Compilation:
Suppose you're on a macOS machine (darwin/amd64) and want to compile a program for a Linux server running on an AMD64 processor. You would set the environment variables and compile like this:


GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myprogram
This command creates an executable (myprogram) that can run on a Linux AMD64 machine
