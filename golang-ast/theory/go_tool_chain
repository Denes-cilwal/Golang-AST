The "Go toolchain" refers to a collection of tools provided with the Go programming language installation that are used for various stages of Go program development and management.
These tools are essential for tasks like writing, formatting, compiling, testing, and managing Go code. The key components of the Go toolchain include:

go command: This is the central command for managing Go source code. It provides numerous subcommands such as:

go build: Compiles Go programs.
go run: Compiles and runs Go programs.
go test: Runs tests on Go packages.
go get: Adds dependencies to current module and installs them.
go mod: Module maintenance.
go fmt: Formats Go source code.
go doc: Shows documentation for a package or symbol.
go install: Compiles and installs Go packages and dependencies.
go clean: Removes object files and cached files.
Compiler (gc): The Go compiler translates Go source code into executable binaries. This is a key part of the toolchain and is involved in commands like go build and go run.

Linker: After the Go compiler compiles the source code, the linker combines the compiled packages into an executable binary.
 The Go linker handles tasks like resolving package dependencies and creating a standalone executable.


Runtime: The Go runtime is part of the toolchain that provides support for essential features such as goroutines (for concurrency), garbage collection, and interface type checks.
eThe runtime is included in every Go executable


Linker
Combining Object Files: If your program consists of multiple source files, the compiler generates an object file for each.
The linker combines these separate object files into a single executable file.

Resolving References: Your code might have function calls or references to variables that are defined in different source files.
The linker resolves these references. For instance, if file A calls a function defined in file B, the linker makes sure this call is correctly set up in the executable

Imagine you're building a puzzle. Each piece of the puzzle is like an object file created by the compiler.
The linker's job is to put all these puzzle pieces (object files) together to form the complete picture (the executable program).
It makes sure that each piece is in the right place and connects correctly with the other pieces.
